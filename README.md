# C64-Diagnostic-Rev.-586220-Harness
The Diagnostic Rev. 586220 is a widely accepted test tool for the Commodore C64. It tests the RAM, ROMs and 
the peripheral chips (VIC, SID, CIA). To test all interfaces, a feedback is required. This is provided by this harness.

A fix for existing harnesses is the <b>extended</b> Keyboard Dongle. It can be combined with Rev. 0 of this harness and all other Harnesses. It only requires a connection to the Cassette Port Dongle.
